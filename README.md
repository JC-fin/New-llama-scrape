# New-llama-scrape
Scraping from Llama to find and run some analytics on previous bribes.

Llama airforce is a dashboard that shows data taken from Votium on different bribe periods in Convex. The data for each bribe period is not exportable to CSV so we need to inspect the HTML. As a dynamic website, we need to use a webdriver and selenium to access the script and be able to use some Beautiful Soup functions.
